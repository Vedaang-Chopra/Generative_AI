Agentic System is basically providing  a complete automation of the flow of control of a generative ai APP. Basically agentic system is a complete automation of the flow of control of a generative ai APP. 

Initally we used to just prompt and get the response. But now we can automate the entire flow of control of the application using LLM.


Basics of Langgraph :- Here the entire agentic system is assumed to be a graph. 

So your nodes of the graph are like components, which can constitue of LLM calls, doing any action like tool calls, or just general functions. 

Nodes are always defined in python function logic
def node1(input:State):

For flow of control, you can give LLM more control, or less control. Basic control is done using router where reliaility is high. But there is a way to create fully autnomous agents using
